# Skin-disease-detection-using-Ai

🩺 Skin Disease Detection Web App (AI)

An AI-powered web application for detecting common skin diseases using images. The system analyzes uploaded skin images and predicts the most likely disease along with a confidence percentage.
⚠️ Educational Purpose Only – This project does not replace professional medical diagnosis.

📌 Project Overview

This project is a web-based application that uses Deep Learning (CNN) to classify skin images into common skin disease categories.
  - Users can upload a skin image.
  - The system processes the image.
  - A prediction is returned with confidence scores.
The trained model achieves 98% accuracy on the test dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of AI in medical     image analysis for educational use.


🎯 Project Objectives
1. Provide an initial prediction for common skin diseases.
2. Demonstrate the application of AI in the medical field.
3. Serve as an educational project for students and beginners.
4. Build a high-accuracy CNN model (98% Accuracy).


🦠 Supported Skin Diseases
The model classifies images into four categories:
- Acne
- Eczema
- Psoriasis
- Bening Keratosis


🧠 How the System Works
1. User uploads a skin image.
2. The image is preprocessed (resizing & normalization).
3. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) analyzes the image.
4. The system outputs the predicted disease with confidence percentages.


🛠 Technologies Used
. Python
. TensorFlow / Keras
. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
. Flask (Backend)
. HTML / CSS / JavaScript (Frontend)
. OpenCV / PIL (Image Processing)


📊 Dataset
. Contains labeled images of skin diseases.
. Split into:
    1. Training set
    2. Validation set
    3. Testing set
. Balanced across all four classes.
. Dataset balance contributed to achieving 98% accuracy.


🖥 User Interface
. Simple and clean design.
. Image upload functionality.
. Clear display of prediction results and confidence scores.
